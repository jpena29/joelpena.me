				<h1>Biography</h1>
				<p>
					I was born in February of 1992 in La Vega, Dominican Republic. In 1999 my family moved to
					the United States settling in New Jersey. After graduating high school I attended William Paterson 
					University until I transferred to Rutgers University. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of
					Science in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics and will graduate as a member of the class

				<h1>Interests</h1>
				<p>
					Apart from my interest in computer science and mathematics, I enjoy watching and participating in sports.
					In the winter of 2012-2013 I was lucky enough to try a new activity and learned how to snowboard. I am excited that this winter has already started to go snowboarding and see if I haven't forgotten what I learned.
